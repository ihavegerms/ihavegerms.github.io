Hi :]

My name is Darren Carpenter and I am Openstack Support Engineer for Rackspace. I am married with 4 kids and currently reside in Fort Worth, Texas. I've been a nerd for many years... started off 'chatting' on AOL and trying to install Slackware in the mid 90's and have carried on with my studies since then. 

I joined the military at 17 years old and received a honorable discharge in 2007. Since then I've worked my way up the IT ladder. Datacenter support to help desk, from help desk to desktop support, to Linux e-mail encryption support, to Linux engineer (cloud)... and in most recent years, from public cloud to private cloud. I love technology, and I am a huge 'cloud' fan. I am very thankful for the opportunity Rackspace has provided me and if you are reading this and are currently in the market for a solid career with a group of hard-working + good people, check out our homepage;

I am interested in a wide variety of things, but currently I am working on leveling up my Kubernetes and Python skills. My free time is divided amongst my family and playing with my labs. (Jenkins/Kubernetes are getting the most playtime currently)
